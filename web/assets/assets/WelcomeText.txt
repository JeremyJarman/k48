You have been chosen for this program not because you are the best, but because your mission is borderline suicidal, and quite frankly you are somewhat expendable. As you're painfully aware our home star (Sol) is not long for this universe, soon it will expand into a red dwarf engulfing the inner solar system, an event human life on earth will surely not survive.

In the late 2100s an ancient civilization, with the forethought of this future predicament, launched a series of probes to explore the galaxy, these probes have been travelling for over 1500 years setting up warp gates at each light-year interval. Your mission is simply to traverse as many warp gates as possible, searching for habitable planets along the way. But be careful our long forgotten ancestors, in an effort to protect this interstellar highway, passcode protected each warp gate with a noun-article pair, more of twisted joke than an actual security system, you have a 1 in 3 chance of guessing the correct pairing but attempting to enter a gate with the wrong pairing will slam your vessel to an immediate stop, not only will your momentum be lost but the sudden deceleration will also cause serious damage to your ship. A skilled pilot may develop a "sense" for these seemingly random pairings, as for you, perhaps memorization might be the best approach for now.

Good luck out there - you'll need it.
